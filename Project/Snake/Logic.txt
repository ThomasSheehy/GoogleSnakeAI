LOGIC FOR SNAKE:

		Current situation:
		The code identifies lines, it doesn't know what to do with them nor can it recognise them at the
		moment.

		Firstly needs to identify different distances towards lines/walls/boundaries (the snake moves in
		squares so distance to wall could decrease from 5 [squares] to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 to 0 before the 
		snake hits the wall)

		Movement of snake is already inputted so just need a logic to code and for the if statements to
		state as well as mathematcis stating distances to each boundary and so where the snake should move.

		Need an if statement saying if distance to line is > 1, then move away from the line, following
		this logic, the snake should in theory not be able to bump into a boundary unless it is a corner
		or it's own body when it traps itself.
